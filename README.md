# ‚õÖ Simple weather app ‚õÖ

Another JavaScript based application which was a part of my aim to refresh my basic JavaScript knowledge. This simple weather app uses Accu Weather API to retrieve current weather conditions for specified city of our choice.

The weather icon is dynamically changed to graphicly inform the user about the current weather. Additionally, based on the current time of the day for selected city ‚Äì the user is greeted with different background image.

Worth to mention ‚Äì the last entered city name is stored in the local storage. Returning user will be welcomed with the current weather status for his last searched location.

Currently, I am working on more advance weather app which will use geolocation and it will allow the user to see the weather forecast for the next few days. I might use Firebase for this upcoming integration to allow any user to create an account and store his favourites cities.
